Core functionality of the `retrofire` project.

Includes a math library with strongly typed vectors, matrices, colors, and
angles; basic geometry primitives; a software 3D renderer with customizable
shaders; with more to come.


============================== Crate features ================================

  * std:
    Makes available items requiring I/O, timekeeping, or any floating-point
    functions not included in `core`. In particular this means trigonometric
    and transcendental functions. If this feature is disabled, the crate only
    depends on `alloc`.

  * libm:
    Provides software implementations of floating-point functions via the
    `libm` crate (https://crates.io/crates/libm).

  * `mm`
    Provides fast approximate implementations of floating-point functions
    via the `micromath` crate (https://crates.io/crates/micromath).

All features are disabled by default.
